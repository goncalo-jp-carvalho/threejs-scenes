This project is a 3D scene created using Three.js. It includes various objects and lighting effects, and allows for user interaction through keyboard inputs.

- By pressing the 'V(v)' key, you can visualize the textures that are generated by pressing the '1' and '2' keys in the scene.
- You can access the project contents online at the following link: [https://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~ist198580/cg/](https://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~ist198580/cg/)
- We have kept the three.min.js file in the js/ folder because we prefer the way the Phong materials are represented in that version. However, we have kept the three.js as the default in the index.html because it allows us to apply the displacement map to the MeshLambertMaterial.
